# A Talk on Ragalur Expressions

Using Ragas, scales from Indian Classical Music, you will get to know the Brzozowski Derivative. 
The Brzozowski Derivative is a more intuitive way to match strings using Regular Expressions, than the standard Thompson's construction algorithm. 
Functional concepts such as Laziness, Memoization and Least Fixed Point can enhance the capabilities of Derivatives to even validate Recursive Regular Expressions (Context Free Grammars). 
Finally we'll see what I use derivatives for.

## Slides

The [slides](https://github.com/awalterschulze/ragax/raw/gh-pages/latex/ragax.pdf) are located in the latex folder.

## Demos

The code is split into 2 projects:

  - ragabot: the albeton, maxjs and javascript folders.  Open the albeton live project and start playing.
  - playground: the golang and root folders.  Open the [playground website](http://awalterschulze.github.io/ragax/).
