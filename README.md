# A Talk on Ragalur Expressions

In this talk Ragas, scales from Indian Classical Music, will be used to explain the Brzozowski Derivative. 
The Brzozowski Derivative is a more intuitive way to match strings using Regular Expressions, than the standard Thompson's construction algorithm.
Functional concepts such as Laziness, Memoization and Fixed Point analysis can expand the capabilities of the Derivative to even validate Recursive Regular Expressions (Context Free Grammars).â€‹
Finally you will see what I use derivatives for.
